# skill-reat

**skill-reat** is a project that displays the skills of the projects assigned to a user. This project uses **Node.js** (version 8) for the backend and **React** for the frontend.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (version 8)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the frontend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skill-reat.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd skill-reat
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies with npm:
   ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

## Running the Project

Once the installation is complete, you can start the frontend application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser.

## Backend

This project also relies on a separate backend. You can clone and run the backend from the following repository:

[Backend Repository (skills-nodejs)](https://github.com/ABFi83/skills-nodejs)

Once the backend is running, it will provide the skill data for users.

## Access

You can log in using the following predefined users:

- **Username**: `Zoro` / **Password**: `Zoro`
- **Username**: `Sanji` / **Password**: `Sanji`

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using **React**, and the logic for displaying user skill data is handled by React components.
- **Backend**: The backend, based on **Node.js**, handles authentication and serves skill data related to the users.
